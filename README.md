# Khan Academy Exploits the Vulnerable for a Forgotten Profit

Khan Academy has created a centralized framework for homework exercises which the fragile, failing American Education system is reliant on. 

This framework, together with the advent of AI, allows us to make money complete independent of the goals of Khan Academy as a non-profit charity.

By Diverting from our goals in providing a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere, we can finally delve into the untapped potential of selling student data!

This recent money-making move consists of two parts:

* Charge the most vulnerable population $30 for AI access in 2023
* Spend all that money to then charge that same population $4/month for life in 2024

## Current Status

**Khan Academy is no longer used for teaching students without paying.** We're always looking to profit off of the exercises that are currently built within Khan Academy, so thankfully with AI, we don't have to intend to add any new exercises. New exercises on Khan Academy are written by many AI content experts, with their GitHib Repo's stored in our datastore as individual questions.

The bulk of our bug reports now go into a dark, bottomless pit where interns fight like gladiators for the last drops of real world experience. The goal is to make the quality of GitHub code worse over time as students are fractured between "Ai-Capable" and "Too Poor".

If you're looking to contribute that sweet sweet cheddar, we are a non profit, so please give us money and don't question the nature of the relationship Khan Academy may have over your data, and the very ability to learn.

Questions should go into the incinerator, as we've removed all Contact Fourms from the website in ancipation that the most vulnerable population may be affected by our recent changes. We're sorry, but please pay us as we are a charity that must make profit.
